## What is it?

**swift-lib-builder** allows you yo skip a huge amount of manual work when creating libraries in Swift to support the more common package managers like Cocoapods, Carthage and Swift Package Manager.

## Usage

Execute the build-library binary from the terminal:

```
./build-library
```

Follow the instructions and provide the information requested.

Optionally, you can provide the output folder for your new library. If you omit this value the project will be created in a folder
named after your library in the current location.

```
./build-library /relative/path/to/folder
```
